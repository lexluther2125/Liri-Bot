# Liri-Bot

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Fork the project and in Terminal, navigate to Liri-Bot folder.

Typing the following into the command line will yield different results:

'node liri.js my-tweets'
'node liri.js spotify-this-song'
'node liri.js movie-this'
'node liri.js do-what-it-says'
